# React & React-Router-DOM

Created A Basic web application which have multiple route and load different component based on the web url.

Done with the help of `react-router-dom` npm package
Learned A React Hooks like:

- useParams
- loader & useLoaderData in `react-router-dom`

1. **Loader** Allow to you to make a API Request when user hover over a navlink or button and stored it in cache to provide fast response.

2. **useLoaderData** it is a hook provided by `react-router-dom` to utlize or retrive data through loader cache.
